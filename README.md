# azvms.info

This project is originally a copy of [azure-instances.info](https://github.com/doitintl/azure-instances.info), which has not been updated since 2022 and archived since 2024.

I found this to previously be an invaluable tool in comparing Azure VM sizes and, perhaps more importantly, quickly determining which VMs met my *minimum* requirements.

## Why not just use an existing tool like Vantage?

Vantage and tools like it are great (and Vantage started as the ultimate source of this project - ec2-instances.info) - but they focus on the commercials of Azure VMs rather than their technical capabilities. This isn't a bad thing, and is an important consideration when choosing the size and deployment region for your IaaS resources - but it's not the full story. This tool aims to provide both the technical and commercial data to allow users to make a fully informed decision.

### Isn't that what Cloudprice.net does?

Sure is! Which is the second reason for this project - personal growth! My background hasn't involved a lot of front-end web hosting and I hope to use this project as an opportunity to improve my understanding of front-end frameworks and tools; initially maintaining this HTML/CSS/JS static site, and perhaps in the future migrating to something like a Blazor app. Who know's where the journey takes me.

I also control the data that I publish in this project, which means that I can improve it in ways that other projects don't allow me to - for example, adding Managed Disk specifications and costs for comparison too.

## Want to contribute?

I welcome anyone to call out issues with the project and it's implementation; however, given this is intended as a journey of personal growth I would not accept enhancements or fixes at this time.

## Want to copy it for yourself?

Please do! The licensing allows for anyone to copy this project, so long as it is used only for open-source projects.
